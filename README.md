# Music-Downloader
Easily download songs from a search query instead of having to provide a link.

# installation
Clone the repo and run ui.py to run. You will have to instal dependancies. I will create an installer in the future.
provide your [spotify client id and secret](https://stevesie.com/docs/pages/spotify-client-id-secret-developer-api) in the auth.py file If no api keys are provided, the file will be called "file.mp3" and have no metadata.

# Music source
All music comes from YouTube. Only use Music Downloader to download copyright-free music, we do not endorse piracy. Metadata comes from the spotily api.
